#### bugs n stuff

* figure out why knockback in the y direction is so strong
* fix player can stick to walls? or is that good?
* check interaction with head colliders when already attached
* transform tree traversal is not fun... how to make it easier to work with?
* super basic tilemap
* some kind of global sound variables for characters to point to?
* running swords into each other inconsistent?

#### design problems
* can't move some enemies through levels
  * bounce pad? enemy with a bouncing attack? unlock and select power?
* would be interesting to design levels that need enemies to beat, but enemies can die
  * spawners to prevent softlock? invulnerable enemies?
